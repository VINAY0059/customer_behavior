🛒 Customer Behavior Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
This project focuses on analyzing and segmenting customer behavior based on their purchasing data. By applying unsupervised machine learning techniques such as K-Means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the project aims to uncover hidden patterns in customer activity that can help businesses personalize marketing strategies, improve customer engagement, and increase sales.

📌 Objective
The goal of this project is to:

Segment customers into meaningful groups based on spending behavior and shopping frequency.

Visualize these customer clusters in a simple and interpretable format.

Demonstrate a practical machine learning workflow using real-world-style data.

📁 Dataset Overview
Source: Customer_Behavior_Data.csv

Features Used:

total_spent: Total amount spent by the customer.

avg_purchase_value: Average value per purchase.

visits_per_month: Frequency of monthly visits.

buyer_type: (Categorical, used for reference but excluded from clustering)

🔧 Methodology
Data Cleaning

Removed null/missing values

Selected only relevant numerical features for clustering

Feature Scaling

Applied StandardScaler to normalize the feature space for fair distance-based clustering

Optimal Clustering (Elbow Method)

Used the Elbow Method to determine the ideal number of clusters by analyzing Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)

K-Means Clustering

Applied the K-Means algorithm with the optimal cluster count

Assigned each customer to a cluster based on behavior similarity

PCA & Visualization

Reduced data to 2D using PCA for easy visualization

Created scatter plots to clearly depict customer segments

🧰 Technologies & Libraries
Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

pandas – data manipulation

scikit-learn – clustering, scaling, PCA

matplotlib, seaborn – visualization
